## Manual

This project is totally written with JS, CSS and HTML. I used CSS and JS for implementing all effects, which have enhanced the performance. Although the page is easy to follow, I want to mention that there is a theme changer button in the menu as well. The image below shows how to set it:

I tried to make the page look attractive to the user. Feel free to contact me if you have any comments or questions.
