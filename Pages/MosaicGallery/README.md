## Manual

<img src="docs/docs_1.jpg" alt="Mosaic art gallery demo image 1">

This project is totally written with JS, CSS and HTML. I used CSS and JS for implementing all effects, which have enhanced the performance. Some of the features of the mosaic art gallery are as follows:

- Generating photo album according to the existing images,
- Changing background and font colors in real-time,
- Using lazy loading images which allows the user to see the small blurred image before the image is fully loaded,
- Fully responsive,
- CSS effects.

I tried to make the page look attractive to the user. Feel free to contact me if you have any comments or questions.
