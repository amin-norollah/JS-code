# Welcome to my open-source JS (and .Net) projects

I am the back-end JS developer and currently designing RESTful API using the ExpressJS, mongidb and swapper frameworks and tools. Besides it, I have a special interest in front-end designing, and sometimes I design vanilla JS pages. Although designing the web pages using a ReactJS framework is more popular todays, I prefer to share my thoughts with vanilla JS on this page, because I think it is much more fun and easier to understand and share.

I hope my projects could be helpful and interesting, and I am looking forward to give your feedbacks and experiences as well.

The following is a list of pages that I developed:

## 1. **Web development projects**
 Here I want to introduce the new open-source projects that I developed.
 
 ### CSite back-end using .Net 6:
 It is my first full open-source back-end project that I used it for my teaching as well. I tried to use the most recent and modern technologies in their development.
 The below list is the main technologies that I used:
- Build data-driven RESTful API
- Using MS SQL server database and Entity framework
- Using Unit of Work
- Exception handler and response wrapper using AutoWrapper
- Generic controllers and dependency injection 
- Managing controllers using helper
- Logging with Serilog
- API documentation using SwaggerUI
- Authentication and authorization using IdentityServer4
- Using DTOs and Authomapper
- Versioning
- 
for more information, please see [CSite Backend project](https://github.com/amin-norollah/CSite_Backend_dotNet6).

### CSite front-end using Angular
It is my first open-source Angular project that I could share publicly. This project will connect to [CSite Backend project](https://github.com/amin-norollah/CSite_Backend_dotNet6) and work with it. Therefore, one should have enough knowledge to run both the .Net 6 back-end and Angular user interface in order to use these projects.

for more information, please see [CSite Frontend project](https://github.com/amin-norollah/CSite_Frontend_Angular).


## 2. **Pages**
- [**Matrix effect**](https://amin-norollah.github.io/JS-code/Pages/MatrixEffect/): It is one of my favorite projects. Do you remember the strings of machine codes effect in the Matrix movies? This project is a **fully optimized matrix code animated background**. It is not written by me, but I developed and optimized it and tried to make it similar to one in the Matrix movies.
- [**_Flight booking demo_**](https://amin-norollah.github.io/JS-code/Pages/FlightBooking/): a responsive web page to search, book and manage international flight tickets ([more information](https://github.com/amin-norollah/JS-code/tree/main/Pages/FlightBooking)).
- [**_Business webpage demo_**](https://amin-norollah.github.io/JS-code/Pages/BusinessWebpage/): a classical web page suitable for business plans. This page is responsive and has a bunch of visual effects, such as a theme changer. It is worthy to note that all effects have been implemented manually, which boosts performance ([more information](https://github.com/amin-norollah/JS-code/tree/main/Pages/BusinessWebpage)).
- [**_Mosaic art gallery demo_**](https://amin-norollah.github.io/JS-code/Pages/MosaicGallery/): this image photo gallery is fully responsive, uses a new features of vanilla JS to make much more interesting image grids album, and adapts to the browser using a nice and smooth animation ([more information](https://github.com/amin-norollah/JS-code/tree/main/Pages/MosaicGallery)).
- [**_Nastaligh (SVG artwork)_**](https://amin-norollah.github.io/JS-code/Pages/Nastaligh/): it is interesting to work with SVG files and learn how to add some effects to those files. On this page, you can see I added gradient color and shadow to an SVG artwork, and it will change whenever the mouse hover or enter its area.

## 3. **Charts**

- [**_Heatmap demo_**](https://amin-norollah.github.io/JS-code/Charts/Heatmap/): a responsive and easy to use project for creating heatmap chart with the resolution between 10x10 and 80x80 pixels. I should mention that I did not use any library for implementing it. Thanks to CSS blur effect, the smooth results could be generated with higher resolution that can increase the performance ([more information](https://github.com/amin-norollah/JS-code/tree/main/Charts/Heatmap)).

## 4. **Games**

- [**_Roll dice game_**](https://amin-norollah.github.io/JS-code/Games/RollDice): a simple dice game; whoever can get the most score wins!
- [**_XO game manually_**](https://amin-norollah.github.io/JS-code/Games/XO-manual): a responsive XO game where two users can play with each other.
- [**_XO game wth CPU_**](https://amin-norollah.github.io/JS-code/Games/XO-CPU): it has a simple JS code to make it possible that the CPU plays with human.
