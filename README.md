## Welcome to my open-source JS projects

JavaScript is very attractive to me because it is one of the core technologies of the web and is a powerful programming language that can be used to design many web pages, alongside HTML and CSS. This repository is designed by the goal of sharing some interesting designs with others. I hope my projects can help you and you would share your experience with me as well.

The following is a list of projects that I developed:

(Games)

- [Roll dice game](https://amin-norollah.github.io/JS-code/Games/RollDice): a simple dice game; whoever can get the most score wins!
- [XO game manually](https://amin-norollah.github.io/JS-code/Games/XO-manual): a responsive XO game where two users can play with each other.
- [XO game wth CPU](https://amin-norollah.github.io/JS-code/Games/XO-CPU): it has a simple JS code to make it possible that the CPU plays with human.
- (in process)

(Pages)

- [Flight booking demo](https://amin-norollah.github.io/JS-code/Pages/FlightBooking/): a responsive web page to search, book and manage international flight tickets ([more information](https://github.com/amin-norollah/JS-code/tree/main/Pages/FlightBooking)).
- [Business webpage demo](https://amin-norollah.github.io/JS-code/Pages/BusinessWebpage/): a classical web page suitable for business plans. It is responsive and has a bunch of visual effects, such as a theme changer. It is worthy to note that all effects have been implemented manually, which increases performance ([more information](https://github.com/amin-norollah/JS-code/tree/main/Pages/BusinessWebpage)).
- [Mosaic art gallery demo](https://amin-norollah.github.io/JS-code/Pages/MosaicGallery/): this image photo gallery is fully responsive, uses a new JS code to make much more interesting image grids, and adapts to the browser using a nice and smooth animation ([more information](https://github.com/amin-norollah/JS-code/tree/main/Pages/MosaicGallery)).
