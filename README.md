## Welcome to my open-source JS projects

JavaScript is one of the core technologies of the web and is a powerful programming language that can be used to design many web pages, alongside HTML and CSS. My goal in designing this repository is to share my knowledge with others and some interesting designs.

The following is a list of created projects:

(Games)
- [Roll dice game](https://amin-norollah.github.io/JS-code/Games/RollDice): a responsive and simple dice game; whoever can get the most score wins!
- [XO game manually](https://amin-norollah.github.io/JS-code/Games/XO-manual): a responsive XO game where two users can play with each other.
- [XO game wth CPU](https://amin-norollah.github.io/JS-code/Games/XO-CPU): it has a JavaScript engine to make it possible for the CPU to play with human.
