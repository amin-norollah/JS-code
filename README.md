## Welcome to my open-source JS projects

JavaScript is very attractive to me because it is one of the core technologies of the web and is a powerful programming language that can be used to design many web pages, alongside HTML and CSS. This repository is designed by the goal of sharing some interesting designs with others. I hope my projects can help you and you would share your experience with me as well.

The following is a list of projects that I developed:

(Games)

- [**_Roll dice game_**](https://amin-norollah.github.io/JS-code/Games/RollDice): a simple dice game; whoever can get the most score wins!
- [**_XO game manually_**](https://amin-norollah.github.io/JS-code/Games/XO-manual): a responsive XO game where two users can play with each other.
- [**_XO game wth CPU_**](https://amin-norollah.github.io/JS-code/Games/XO-CPU): it has a simple JS code to make it possible that the CPU plays with human.
- (in process)

(Pages)

- [**_Flight booking demo_**](https://amin-norollah.github.io/JS-code/Pages/FlightBooking/): a responsive web page to search, book and manage international flight tickets ([more information](https://github.com/amin-norollah/JS-code/tree/main/Pages/FlightBooking)).
- [**_Business webpage demo_**](https://amin-norollah.github.io/JS-code/Pages/BusinessWebpage/): a classical web page suitable for business plans. It is responsive and has a bunch of visual effects, such as a theme changer. It is worthy to note that all effects have been implemented manually, which increases performance ([more information](https://github.com/amin-norollah/JS-code/tree/main/Pages/BusinessWebpage)).
- [**_Mosaic art gallery demo_**](https://amin-norollah.github.io/JS-code/Pages/MosaicGallery/): this image photo gallery is fully responsive, uses a new JS code to make much more interesting image grids, and adapts to the browser using a nice and smooth animation ([more information](https://github.com/amin-norollah/JS-code/tree/main/Pages/MosaicGallery)).
- (in process)

(Charts)

- [**_Heatmap demo_**](https://amin-norollah.github.io/JS-code/Charts/Heatmap/): a responsive and easy to use project for creating heatmap chart with the resolution between 10x10 and 80x80 pixels. Thanks to CSS blur effect, the smooth results could be generated with higher resolution that can increase the performance ([more information](https://github.com/amin-norollah/JS-code/tree/main/Charts/Heatmap)).
