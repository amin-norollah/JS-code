# Welcome to my open-source JS projects

I am a NodeJs developer who designs API using the ExpressJS framework, besides I have a special interest in front-end design, and sometimes I design vanilla JS pages. Although I know how to design web pages using a ReactJS framework, I prefer to share my thoughts with vanilla JS on this page. I think it is much more fun and easier to understand and share.

I hope my projects could be helpful, and I am looking forward to give your feedback and experience as well.

The following is a list of pages that I developed:

## 1. **Pages**

- [**_Flight booking demo_**](https://amin-norollah.github.io/JS-code/Pages/FlightBooking/): a responsive web page to search, book and manage international flight tickets ([more information](https://github.com/amin-norollah/JS-code/tree/main/Pages/FlightBooking)).
- [**_Business webpage demo_**](https://amin-norollah.github.io/JS-code/Pages/BusinessWebpage/): a classical web page suitable for business plans. It is responsive and has a bunch of visual effects, such as a theme changer. It is worthy to note that all effects have been implemented manually, which increases performance ([more information](https://github.com/amin-norollah/JS-code/tree/main/Pages/BusinessWebpage)).
- [**_Mosaic art gallery demo_**](https://amin-norollah.github.io/JS-code/Pages/MosaicGallery/): this image photo gallery is fully responsive, uses a new JS code to make much more interesting image grids, and adapts to the browser using a nice and smooth animation ([more information](https://github.com/amin-norollah/JS-code/tree/main/Pages/MosaicGallery)).
- [**_Nastaligh (SVG art work)_**](https://amin-norollah.github.io/JS-code/Pages/Nastaligh/): it is interesting to work with SVG files and learn how to add some effects to those files. On this page, you can see I added gradient color and shadow to an SVG artwork, and it will change whenever the mouse hover or enter its area.

## 2. **Charts**

- [**_Heatmap demo_**](https://amin-norollah.github.io/JS-code/Charts/Heatmap/): a responsive and easy to use project for creating heatmap chart with the resolution between 10x10 and 80x80 pixels. I should mention that I did not use any library for implementing it. Thanks to CSS blur effect, the smooth results could be generated with higher resolution that can increase the performance ([more information](https://github.com/amin-norollah/JS-code/tree/main/Charts/Heatmap)).

## 3. **Games**

- [**_Roll dice game_**](https://amin-norollah.github.io/JS-code/Games/RollDice): a simple dice game; whoever can get the most score wins!
- [**_XO game manually_**](https://amin-norollah.github.io/JS-code/Games/XO-manual): a responsive XO game where two users can play with each other.
- [**_XO game wth CPU_**](https://amin-norollah.github.io/JS-code/Games/XO-CPU): it has a simple JS code to make it possible that the CPU plays with human.
