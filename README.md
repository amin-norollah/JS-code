## Welcome to my open-source JS projects

JavaScript is very attractive to me because it is one of the core technologies of the web and is a powerful programming language that can be used to design many web pages, alongside HTML and CSS. This repository is designed by the goal of sharing some interesting designs with others. I hope my projects can help you and you would share your experience with me as well.

The following is a list of projects that I developed:

(Games)

- [Roll dice game](https://amin-norollah.github.io/JS-code/Games/RollDice): a simple dice game; whoever can get the most score wins!
- [XO game manually](https://amin-norollah.github.io/JS-code/Games/XO-manual): a responsive XO game where two users can play with each other.
- [XO game wth CPU](https://amin-norollah.github.io/JS-code/Games/XO-CPU): it has a JavaScript engine to make it possible for the CPU to play with human.
- (in process)

(Pages)

- [Flight booking demo](https://amin-norollah.github.io/JS-code/Pages/FlightBooking/): a responsive web page to search, book and manage for international flight tickets ([more information](https://github.com/amin-norollah/JS-code/tree/main/Pages/FlightBooking)).
